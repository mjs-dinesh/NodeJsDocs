### Buffer

#### InterviewBit

##### 1.What are node.js buffers?

In general, buffers is a temporary memory that is mainly used by stream to hold on to some data until consumed. Buffers are introduced with additional use cases than JavaScriptâ€™s Unit8Array and are mainly used to represent a fixed-length sequence of bytes. This also supports legacy encodings like ASCII, utf-8, etc. It is a fixed(non-resizable) allocated memory outside the v8.

```js
const buffer1 = Buffer.alloc(10);
buffer1.write("I'm Dinesh mjs ...");
console.log(buffer1.toString());
```
