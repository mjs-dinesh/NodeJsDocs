### Objects

##### 1.How would you clone an object?

In JavaScript, there are a few ways to clone an object:

1. Using the spread operator:

```javascript
const originalObj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
const clonedObj = { ...originalObj };
```

2. Using `Object.assign()`:

```javascript
const originalObj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
const clonedObj = Object.assign({}, originalObj);
```

3. Using `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`:

```javascript
const originalObj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
const clonedObj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObj));
```

It's important to note that the first two methods will only create a shallow clone of the object, meaning that any nested objects or arrays will still be references to the original object. The third method will create a deep clone, but it won't work if the object contains functions, symbols or undefined values.
