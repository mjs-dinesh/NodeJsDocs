### REPL

REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop. It is a built-in feature of Node.js that allows developers to interactively test and run code snippets without having to create a separate file. It provides a console-like environment where developers can input code, and the results of the code execution are immediately displayed.

In other words, REPL is a command-line tool that evaluates and executes code, line by line. It is useful for testing out small pieces of code, exploring APIs and libraries, and debugging.

To start a Node.js REPL, open a terminal window and type `node` on the command line. This will launch the Node.js environment, and you can start typing JavaScript code to execute.

```js
const repl = require("node:repl");
const msg = "message";

repl.start(">>> ").context.m = msg;
```
