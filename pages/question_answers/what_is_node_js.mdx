### Node JS Architecture

#### 1.What is Node architecture and what does it include?

##### ChatGPT Solution.

###### Node.js architecture refers to the internal design and structure of Node.js, which includes several key components.

1. **V8 Engine**: Node.js uses the V8 engine to execute JavaScript code. The V8 engine is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google, which compiles and executes JavaScript code at a very high speed.

2. **Libuv**: Node.js uses Libuv for handling I/O operations, such as file I/O, network I/O, and timers. Libuv is a multi-platform support library that provides asynchronous I/O capabilities.

3. **Modules**: Node.js has a modular architecture, which allows developers to write and use modules to organize their code. Modules can be easily imported and exported using the `require()` and `module.exports` methods.

4. **Event Loop**: Node.js follows an event-driven architecture, which includes an event loop. The event loop is responsible for handling asynchronous operations and executing callback functions when they are ready.

5. **Global Object**: Node.js provides a global object that includes several built-in modules and functions, such as `console`, `process`, and `Buffer`.

6. **Native Add-ons**: Node.js allows developers to write C/C++ add-ons to extend its functionality and performance.

Overall, the architecture of Node.js is designed to be highly scalable and efficient, making it well-suited for building high-performance, real-time applications.

##### 1.What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library used to run web applications outside the client's browser. Ryan Dahl developed it in 2009, and the latest version, v13.8.0, was released on Jan. 30. Node.js is used to create server-side web applications and is perfect for data-intensive applications since it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model

##### 2.Node.js Architecture

Node.js uses the "Single Threaded Event Loop" architecture to handle multiple concurrent clients. The Node.js processing model is based on the JavaScript event-based model, along with the JavaScript callback mechanism.

Clients send requests to Web Server.

Requests can be: Querying for data, Deleting data, Updating the data, etc.

Node.js adds the requests to the Event Queue

Event Loop checks if the requests are simple enough not to require any external resources

Event Loop processes simple requests and returns the responses to the corresponding clients

A single thread from Thread Pool is assigned to a single complex request

Thread Pool performs the required task and returns the response to Event Loop, which in turn, returns the response to the client
