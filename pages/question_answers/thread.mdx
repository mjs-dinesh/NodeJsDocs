##### 1.What is a thread pool and which library handles it in Node.js

The Thread pool is handled by the libuv library. libuv is a multi-platform C library that provides support for asynchronous I/O-based operations such as file systems, networking, and concurrency.

##### 2. How are worker threads different from clusters?

**Cluster:**

There is one process on each CPU with an IPC to communicate.

In case we want to have multiple servers accepting HTTP requests via a single port, clusters can be helpful.

The processes are spawned in each CPU thus will have separate memory and node instance which further will lead to memory issues.

**Worker threads:**

There is only one process in total with multiple threads.

Each thread has one Node instance (one event loop, one JS engine) with most of the APIs accessible.

Shares memory with other threads (e.g. SharedArrayBuffer)

This can be used for CPU-intensive tasks like processing data or accessing the file system since NodeJS is single-threaded, synchronous tasks can be made more efficient leveraging the worker's threads.
