### Variables

##### 1.What is the difference in var and let?

In JavaScript, `var` and `let` are used to declare variables but there is a difference in how they work.

The main difference is that `var` is function-scoped while `let` is block-scoped.

When you declare a variable with `var`, it is declared globally or locally to an entire function, regardless of block scope. This means that a variable declared with `var` within a block can still be accessed outside of that block.

On the other hand, when you declare a variable with `let`, it is only accessible within the block it was declared in. This means that a variable declared with `let` within a block cannot be accessed outside of that block.

Here is an example to illustrate the difference:

```js
function example() {
  var x = 1;
  if (true) {
    var x = 2;
    console.log(x); // Output: 2
  }
  console.log(x); // Output: 2
}

function example2() {
  let x = 1;
  if (true) {
    let x = 2;
    console.log(x); // Output: 2
  }
  console.log(x); // Output: 1
}
```

In the `example` function, both `var` variables are accessible within the function, regardless of the block scope. In the `example2` function, the `let` variable is only accessible within its block scope.
