### Array

##### 1.What are the different strategies to merge two arrays?

There are multiple strategies to merge two arrays in JavaScript:

1. Using the `concat()` method: The `concat()` method can be used to concatenate two or more arrays into a new array. It returns a new array that contains elements from both arrays.

   Example:

   ```js
   const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
   const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
   const mergedArray = arr1.concat(arr2);
   console.log(mergedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   ```

2. Using the spread operator: The spread operator (`...`) can be used to spread the elements of one array into another. It creates a new array with the elements from both arrays.

   Example:

   ```js
   const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
   const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
   const mergedArray = [...arr1, ...arr2];
   console.log(mergedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   ```

3. Using the `push()` method: The `push()` method can be used to add elements from one array into another. It modifies the original array and returns the new length of the array.

   Example:

   ```js
   const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
   const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
   arr1.push(...arr2);
   console.log(arr1); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   ```

4. Using the `splice()` method: The `splice()` method can be used to add elements from one array into another at a specified index. It modifies the original array and returns the removed elements.

   Example:

   ```js
   const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
   const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
   arr1.splice(2, 0, ...arr2);
   console.log(arr1); // Output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3]
   ```

5. Using the `concat()` method with spread operator: The `concat()` method can be used with spread operator (`...`) to merge two or more arrays into a new array.

   Example:

   ```js
   const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
   const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
   const mergedArray = [].concat(...arr1, ...arr2);
   console.log(mergedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   ```

##### 2.How do you remove duplicate elements from an array in JavaScript? Provide an example.

To remove duplicate elements from an array in JavaScript, one approach is to use the `Set` object which allows only unique values, and then convert the set back to an array. Here's an example:

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5];
const uniqueArr = [...new Set(arr)];
console.log(uniqueArr); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In this example, the `Set` object is created with the original array `arr`, which contains duplicate elements. Then, the spread syntax (`...`) is used to convert the set back to an array and assign it to the `uniqueArr` variable. The resulting `uniqueArr` array contains only the unique elements from the original array.

##### 3.What is the syntax to add a new element at the beginning of an array in JavaScript?

To add a new element at the beginning of an array in JavaScript, you can use the `unshift()` method. The syntax is as follows:

```js
array.unshift(newElement);
```

Where `array` is the array to which the element needs to be added, and `newElement` is the new element to be added.

Here is an example:

```js
const arr = [2, 3, 4];
arr.unshift(1);
console.log(arr); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
