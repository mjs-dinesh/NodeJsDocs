### Closure

##### 1.What is closures in js?

In JavaScript, a closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer lexical scope, even after the outer function has returned.

To create a closure, you define a function inside another function, and the inner function can access the variables of the outer function, even after the outer function has returned. The inner function forms a closure around the variables of the outer function.

Here's an example:

```js
function outerFunction() {
  let outerVar = "I am in the outer function";

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVar);
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

let closure = outerFunction();
closure(); // Output: "I am in the outer function"
```

In this example, `outerFunction` defines a variable `outerVar` and a function `innerFunction`, which logs the value of `outerVar` to the console. `outerFunction` then returns `innerFunction`.

When we call `outerFunction`, it returns the `innerFunction`, which we assign to the variable `closure`. When we call `closure`, it logs the value of `outerVar` to the console, even though `outerFunction` has already returned. This is because `closure` has formed a closure around the `outerVar` variable.

Closures are often used in JavaScript to create private variables and methods in object-oriented programming, to implement currying and partial application in functional programming, and to manage asynchronous code.

```js
const firstFn = () => {
  let a = "Im outer function variable";
  function secoundFunction() {
    return a;
  }
  return secoundFunction;
};

const fn = firstFn();
console.log(fn()); // Im outer function variable
```
