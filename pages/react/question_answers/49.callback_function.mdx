### What is a callback function?

In JavaScript, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of some operation. The purpose of using callback functions is to ensure that a specific piece of code is executed only after a certain task has been completed, or in response to an event.

Here are some key points about callback functions:

1. **Passing Functions as Arguments:**

   - In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be treated like any other variable. This allows functions to be passed as arguments to other functions.

2. **Asynchronous Operations:**

   - Callback functions are commonly used in scenarios where operations are asynchronous, such as handling the result of a network request, reading a file, or responding to user interactions.

3. **Event Handling:**

   - Callbacks are frequently used in event handling. For example, you might pass a callback function to an event listener, and the function will be executed when the specified event occurs.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Callbacks are also used for error handling in asynchronous operations. Typically, a callback will have two parameters: one for the result and another for an error if one occurs.

### Example:

```javascript
// Synchronous Example
function doSomething(callback) {
  console.log("Doing something...");
  callback(); // Execute the callback function
}

function onComplete() {
  console.log("Operation completed!");
}

doSomething(onComplete);

// Asynchronous Example (using setTimeout)
function asyncOperation(callback) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log("Async operation completed!");
    callback(null, "Result of the async operation");
  }, 2000);
}

function handleResult(error, result) {
  if (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  } else {
    console.log("Result:", result);
  }
}

asyncOperation(handleResult);
```

In the synchronous example, the `doSomething` function takes a callback function (`onComplete`) as an argument and executes it after performing some operation.

In the asynchronous example, the `asyncOperation` function simulates an asynchronous task using `setTimeout` and then executes the callback function (`handleResult`) with the result of the operation.

Callback functions play a significant role in enabling asynchronous programming and enhancing the flexibility of JavaScript. They are a fundamental concept in many JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and patterns, such as Node.js, AJAX requests, and event-driven programming.
