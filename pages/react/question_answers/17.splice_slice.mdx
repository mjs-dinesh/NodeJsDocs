### Differentiate between slice and splice.

`slice` and `splice` are both methods in JavaScript, but they serve different purposes and are used with different data structures.

### `slice()` Method:

- **Purpose:**

  - `slice()` is a method used with arrays. It returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array without modifying the original array.

- **Syntax:**

  ```javascript
  array.slice(start, end);
  ```

  - `start`: The index at which to begin extraction.
  - `end` (optional): The index at which to end extraction. If omitted, `slice()` extracts to the end of the array.

- **Example:**

  ```javascript
  const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const slicedArray = originalArray.slice(1, 4);
  console.log(slicedArray); // Output: [2, 3, 4]
  console.log(originalArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (original array remains unchanged)
  ```

- **Note:**
  - The `slice()` method does not modify the original array; it creates a new array with the selected elements.

### `splice()` Method:

- **Purpose:**

  - `splice()` is a method used with arrays. It is used to change the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.

- **Syntax:**

  ```javascript
  array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...)
  ```

  - `start`: The index at which to start changing the array.
  - `deleteCount`: An integer indicating the number of elements in the array to remove from `start`.
  - `item1, item2, ...` (optional): Elements to add to the array starting at `start`.

- **Example:**

  ```javascript
  const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const splicedArray = originalArray.splice(1, 2, 6, 7);
  console.log(splicedArray); // Output: [2, 3] (removed elements)
  console.log(originalArray); // Output: [1, 6, 7, 4, 5] (original array modified)
  ```

- **Note:**
  - The `splice()` method modifies the original array by adding, removing, or replacing elements in place.

### Summary:

- `slice()` is used to create a shallow copy of a portion of an array without modifying the original array.

- `splice()` is used to modify the contents of an array by adding, removing, or replacing elements.

Remember the key difference: `slice()` creates a new array, while `splice()` modifies the original array.
