### What is a Controlled Component in React?

In React, a controlled component is a component whose form elements (like input, textarea, and select) are controlled by the component's state. The term "controlled" refers to the fact that the component's state controls the value of the input elements, and any user input is handled through React state and onChange handlers.

Here are the key characteristics of controlled components:

1. **State Management:**

   - The value of the input elements is stored in the component's state. This means that the component has a piece of state to represent the current value of the input.

2. **onChange Handler:**

   - User interactions, such as typing in an input field, trigger the `onChange` event. The `onChange` event is then handled by a function that updates the state with the new value.

3. **Single Source of Truth:**

   - The component's state is considered the "single source of truth" for the value of the input element. The input element reflects the state, and any changes to the input are captured and updated in the state.

4. **Example of a Controlled Input:**

   ```jsx
   import React, { useState } from "react";

   const ControlledInput = () => {
     const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");

     const handleInputChange = (event) => {
       setInputValue(event.target.value);
     };

     return (
       <div>
         <label>Enter Text:</label>
         <input type="text" value={inputValue} onChange={handleInputChange} />
         <p>Typed Value: {inputValue}</p>
       </div>
     );
   };
   ```

   In this example, the `inputValue` is controlled by the state, and the `onChange` event is used to update the state with the new value of the input.

Controlled components are beneficial in React for several reasons:

- **Predictable Behavior:** Since the component's state is the source of truth, the behavior of the component is more predictable, making it easier to understand and debug.

- **React State Management:** Controlled components fit well with React's declarative approach to state management, allowing React to efficiently update the DOM when the state changes.

- **Validation and Manipulation:** You can easily validate, manipulate, or perform any custom logic on the input value before updating the state.

While controlled components offer predictability and a clear data flow, they might result in more boilerplate code compared to uncontrolled components in certain situations. The choice between controlled and uncontrolled components depends on the specific requirements and preferences of the application.
