### Explain Life Cycle methods of React JS.

React components have a lifecycle that consists of various phases from initialization to rendering and eventual removal. Class components in React can implement these lifecycle methods to perform different tasks at specific points in the component's existence. Here's an overview of the main lifecycle methods:

1. **Mounting Phase:**

   - **constructor():** This is the first method called when a component is created. It's used for initializing state and binding event handlers.

   - **static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state):** It is called before every render and can be used to update the state based on changes in props.

   - **render():** This method is responsible for rendering the component's UI. It's a pure function and should not modify the component state.

   - **componentDidMount():** Invoked immediately after a component and all its children have been rendered to the DOM. It's often used for tasks like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

2. **Updating Phase:**

   - **static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, nextState):** Similar to the mounting phase, it is called before every render and can be used to update the state based on changes in props.

   - **shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState):** This method is used to optimize performance by allowing or preventing the component from re-rendering. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the component should update.

   - **render():** Re-rendering phase where the component updates its UI.

   - **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState):** Called just before the changes from the current render are committed to the DOM. It enables capturing some information from the DOM before it is potentially changed.

   - **componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot):** Invoked immediately after updating occurs. This method is useful for performing side effects, such as network requests based on the change in props or state.

3. **Unmounting Phase:**

   - **componentWillUnmount():** Invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. It is used for cleanup tasks such as canceling network requests, clearing up subscriptions, or cleaning up timers.

4. **Error Handling:**

   - **static getDerivedStateFromError(error):** Used to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the component tree and log those errors or display a fallback UI.

   - **componentDidCatch(error, info):** Invoked after an error has been thrown by a descendant component. It's used for logging error information.

These lifecycle methods provide developers with the ability to control the behavior of a React component at different stages, ensuring proper initialization, updates, and cleanup. However, it's important to note that with the introduction of React Hooks, some of these lifecycle methods may be used less frequently in favor of hooks like `useEffect`.
