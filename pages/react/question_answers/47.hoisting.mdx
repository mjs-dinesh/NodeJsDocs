Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that you can use a variable or call a function before it is declared in your code. However, it's important to note that only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.

### Hoisting with Variable Declarations:

Let's look at an example involving variable declarations:

```javascript
console.log(myVariable); // Output: undefined
var myVariable = 5;
console.log(myVariable); // Output: 5
```

In this example, `myVariable` is hoisted to the top of its scope during compilation. The first `console.log` statement doesn't throw an error, but it logs `undefined` because the initialization (`= 5`) is not hoisted. The second `console.log` statement logs the actual value of `myVariable`.

### Hoisting with Function Declarations:

Function declarations are also hoisted. This means you can call a function before it appears in the code:

```javascript
sayHello(); // Output: "Hello, world!"
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

In this example, the `sayHello` function is hoisted to the top of its scope, so the function call before the declaration works as expected.

### Hoisting and Variable Initialization:

It's crucial to understand that only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations. In the case of variables declared with `var`, the initialization is implicitly set to `undefined` during hoisting:

```javascript
console.log(myVariable); // Output: undefined
var myVariable = 5;
console.log(myVariable); // Output: 5
```

In this example, even though `myVariable` is hoisted, the first `console.log` statement outputs `undefined` because the initialization is not hoisted.

### Hoisting with `let` and `const`:

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted but have a different behavior compared to `var`. With `let` and `const`, the variable is hoisted, but it is not initialized until the actual declaration in the code:

```javascript
console.log(myVariable); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myVariable' before initialization
let myVariable = 5;
console.log(myVariable); // Output: 5
```

In this example, the first `console.log` statement throws a `ReferenceError` because the variable is not initialized until the line where it's declared.

### Hoisting with Function Expressions:

It's important to note that function expressions (where a function is assigned to a variable) are not hoisted in the same way as function declarations:

```javascript
sayHello(); // TypeError: sayHello is not a function
var sayHello = function () {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
};
```

In this example, the function expression is not hoisted, and trying to call `sayHello` before the assignment results in a `TypeError`.

In summary, hoisting in JavaScript allows you to use variables and call functions before their actual declarations in the code. However, it's essential to understand the nuances, especially regarding variable initialization and the differences between `var`, `let`, `const`, and function expressions.
