### What is the difference between state and props?

In React, both state and props are used to manage and pass data within a component, but they serve different purposes and have key differences.

### Props (Properties):

1. **Immutable:**

   - Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified or changed within the component that receives them. They are passed down from parent to child components.

2. **Parent to Child Communication:**

   - Props are used for communication between parent and child components. A parent component can pass data to its child components through props.

3. **Read-Only:**

   - Child components cannot modify the props they receive. They are considered read-only within the component that receives them.

4. **Function Parameters:**

   - Props are similar to function parameters. They provide a way to pass information to a component when it is created.

5. **Example:**

   ```jsx
   // Parent component
   const ParentComponent = () => {
     const data = "Hello from Parent";
     return <ChildComponent message={data} />;
   };

   // Child component
   const ChildComponent = (props) => {
     return <p>{props.message}</p>;
   };
   ```

### State:

1. **Mutable:**

   - State represents the internal state of a component and can be mutable. Components can update their state, triggering a re-render.

2. **Local to the Component:**

   - State is local to the component that declares it. It is used for managing and reflecting changes within the component itself.

3. **Managed by Component:**

   - State is managed and modified within the component that declares it. It is used for handling dynamic data that may change over time due to user interactions or other factors.

4. **Set by `setState`:**

   - Changes to the state are made using the `setState` method, which ensures that React is aware of the changes and can trigger a re-render.

5. **Example:**

   ```jsx
   // Component with state
   class Counter extends React.Component {
     constructor(props) {
       super(props);
       this.state = {
         count: 0,
       };
     }

     increment = () => {
       this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
     };

     render() {
       return (
         <div>
           <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
           <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
         </div>
       );
     }
   }
   ```

### Summary:

- **Props** are external inputs to a component, passed down from its parent. They are immutable and read-only within the component that receives them.
- **State** is internal to a component, allowing it to manage and update its own data. State is mutable and can be modified using `setState`.

In a typical React application, data flows from parent to child components through props, while state is used to manage the internal dynamic data of a component. Understanding when to use state and props is crucial for designing React components effectively.
