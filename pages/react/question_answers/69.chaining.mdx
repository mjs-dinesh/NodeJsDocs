### What is chaining in JavaScript and how is it used to call multiple methods on an object in

a single statement? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.

Chaining in JavaScript refers to the practice of calling multiple methods on an object in a single statement. This is possible because many methods in JavaScript return the object they were called on, allowing for a chain of method calls one after the other.

Here's an example to illustrate chaining:

```javascript
// Example object with chainable methods
const person = {
  firstName: "",
  lastName: "",

  setFirstName: function (firstName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    return this; // Return the object for chaining
  },

  setLastName: function (lastName) {
    this.lastName = lastName;
    return this; // Return the object for chaining
  },

  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
};

// Using chaining to set values and get the full name in a single statement
const fullName = person.setFirstName("John").setLastName("Doe").fullName();

console.log(fullName); // Output: John Doe
```

In this example:

1. The `setFirstName` method sets the `firstName` property of the `person` object and returns the object itself (`this`) to allow chaining.
2. The `setLastName` method sets the `lastName` property and also returns the object for chaining.
3. The `fullName` method returns the concatenated full name.

By using chaining, you can perform multiple operations on the same object in a concise and readable manner. It's a common pattern in many JavaScript libraries and frameworks. However, not all methods support chaining, and it depends on whether the methods explicitly return the object for chaining.
