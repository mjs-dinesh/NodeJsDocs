### Explain React Architecture.

React follows a component-based architecture, which is one of its key features. The architecture can be broadly explained in the following components:

1. **Components:**

   - **Functional Components:** These are simple, stateless components that take props as input and return React elements as output.
   - **Class Components:** These are more feature-rich components that can have their own internal state, lifecycle methods, and more.

2. **Props:**

   - Components can take inputs known as props (short for properties). Props are immutable and are used to pass data from parent components to child components.

3. **State:**

   - State is mutable and managed within a component. It represents the current condition of the component and can change over time in response to user actions, network responses, etc. State changes trigger re-rendering of the component.

4. **Virtual DOM:**

   - React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance. Instead of directly manipulating the actual DOM, React creates a virtual representation of it in memory. When there are changes, React calculates the most efficient way to update the actual DOM, minimizing the number of manipulations.

5. **Reconciliation:**

   - React's virtual DOM allows for efficient updates by using a process called reconciliation. It compares the current virtual DOM with a previous version and determines the most efficient way to update the actual DOM.

6. **Lifecycle Methods:**

   - Class components have lifecycle methods that allow developers to execute code at different points in the component's life. For example, `componentDidMount` is called after a component is rendered for the first time.

7. **JSX (JavaScript XML):**

   - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React. It looks similar to XML/HTML but ultimately gets transpiled to JavaScript. JSX makes it easier to write and reason about the structure of UI components.

8. **React Router:**

   - For building single-page applications, React Router is commonly used. It enables navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps UI in sync with the URL.

9. **Flux and Redux (optional):**
   - While not strictly part of React itself, many React applications use state management libraries like Redux or Flux to manage the state of the entire application in a predictable way, especially for larger and more complex applications.
