JSX, or JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension for JavaScript used with React to describe what the UI should look like. It looks similar to XML or HTML, but it's not a string nor HTML. JSX provides a concise and readable way to write React components.

Here are some key points about JSX:

1. **Embedding Expressions:**

   - JSX allows you to embed JavaScript expressions within curly braces `{}`. This enables dynamic content and expressions to be included directly within the markup.

   ```jsx
   const name = "John";
   const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
   ```

2. **HTML-Like Syntax:**

   - JSX resembles HTML, making it familiar and easy for developers who are already accustomed to writing markup.

   ```jsx
   const element = <div className="container">Hello, JSX!</div>;
   ```

3. **Attributes:**

   - JSX uses HTML-like attributes to define properties and pass data to React components.

   ```jsx
   const imageUrl = "https://example.com/image.jpg";
   const imageElement = <img src={imageUrl} alt="Example" />;
   ```

4. **Nested Elements:**

   - JSX allows the nesting of elements, just like in HTML.

   ```jsx
   const element = (
     <div>
       <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Item 1</li>
         <li>Item 2</li>
       </ul>
     </div>
   );
   ```

5. **Expressions in Attributes:**

   - JSX allows you to use JavaScript expressions in attributes.

   ```jsx
   const buttonLabel = "Click me!";
   const element = <button disabled={false}>{buttonLabel}</button>;
   ```

6. **JSX Transpilation:**

   - JSX code is not directly understood by browsers. It needs to be transpiled into standard JavaScript using tools like Babel before being served to the browser.

   ```jsx
   // JSX
   const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;

   // Transpiled JavaScript
   const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, JSX!");
   ```

7. **React.createElement:**
   - JSX gets transpiled into calls to `React.createElement()`. The transpiled code is what actually creates React elements in the virtual DOM.

JSX makes the process of writing React components more intuitive and expressive. While it might look like HTML, it's important to remember that JSX is JavaScript underneath, and it gets translated into JavaScript function calls when processed by tools like Babel.
