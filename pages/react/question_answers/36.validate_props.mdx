### How do you validate props in a React component?

In React, you can validate and define the expected types of props that a component should receive by using the `propTypes` property or the `prop-types` library. This is particularly useful for ensuring that components receive the correct data types and shapes for their props, helping catch potential bugs and improve code robustness.

### Using `propTypes` Property:

You can define the `propTypes` property directly on your React component. Here's an example:

```jsx
import React from "react";

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>{this.props.message}</div>;
  }
}

MyComponent.propTypes = {
  message: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
};
```

In this example, the `propTypes` property is defined as a static property of the `MyComponent` class. It specifies that the `message` prop should be a required string. If the `message` prop is not provided or is not of type string, a warning will be shown in the console during development.

### Using `prop-types` Library:

To use the `prop-types` library, you need to install it first:

```bash
npm install prop-types
```

Then, you can import it and use it to define prop types:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>{this.props.message}</div>;
  }
}

MyComponent.propTypes = {
  message: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
};
```

The `prop-types` library provides a set of validators (such as `string`, `number`, `array`, etc.) that you can use to specify the expected types of your props.

### Common `propTypes`:

Here are some common `propTypes` you might use:

- `PropTypes.string`: A string.
- `PropTypes.number`: A number.
- `PropTypes.bool`: A boolean.
- `PropTypes.array`: An array.
- `PropTypes.object`: An object.
- `PropTypes.func`: A function.
- `PropTypes.node`: A React node (string, number, element, or array).
- `PropTypes.element`: A React element.

### Default Prop Values:

You can also provide default values for props using the `defaultProps` property:

```jsx
MyComponent.defaultProps = {
  message: "Default Message",
};
```

This sets a default value for the `message` prop in case it's not provided.

### PropTypes for Functional Components:

For functional components, you can define `propTypes` as a property of the function:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

const MyFunctionalComponent = ({ message }) => {
  return <div>{message}</div>;
};

MyFunctionalComponent.propTypes = {
  message: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
};
```

In summary, validating props in a React component is essential for maintaining code quality and catching potential issues early in development. Whether you use the `propTypes` property or the `prop-types` library, specifying the expected types and shapes of your props enhances code reliability and makes your components more predictable.
