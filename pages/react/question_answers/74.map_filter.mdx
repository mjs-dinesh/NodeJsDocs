### What is the difference between the 'map()' and 'filter()' methods in JavaScript?

Both the `map()` and `filter()` methods in JavaScript are array methods, and they serve different purposes when working with arrays.

### `map()` Method:

The `map()` method creates a new array by calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. It transforms each element of the array based on the provided function and returns a new array of the same length.

#### Syntax:

```javascript
const newArray = array.map((currentValue, index, array) => {
  // Return the new value for the element
});
```

#### Example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((num) => num * 2);

console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

### `filter()` Method:

The `filter()` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a new array containing only the elements for which the callback function returns `true`.

#### Syntax:

```javascript
const newArray = array.filter((currentValue, index, array) => {
  // Return true to include the element in the new array, or false to exclude it
});
```

#### Example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evens = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);

console.log(evens); // Output: [2, 4]
```

### Key Differences:

1. **Purpose:**

   - `map()`: Used for transforming each element of an array based on a provided function.
   - `filter()`: Used for creating a new array with elements that pass a specified condition.

2. **Return Value:**

   - `map()`: Returns a new array of the same length as the original array, with each element transformed based on the provided function.
   - `filter()`: Returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the specified condition.

3. **Callback Function:**

   - `map()`: The callback function should return the transformed value for each element.
   - `filter()`: The callback function should return a boolean (`true` to include the element, `false` to exclude it).

4. **Original Array:**
   - `map()`: Does not modify the original array; it creates a new array with transformed values.
   - `filter()`: Does not modify the original array; it creates a new array with elements that pass the condition.

In summary, `map()` is used for transforming each element, while `filter()` is used for selecting elements based on a condition. Both methods are useful in different scenarios depending on your specific requirements when working with arrays.
