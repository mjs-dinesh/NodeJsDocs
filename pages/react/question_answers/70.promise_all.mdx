### What is Promise.all() in JavaScript and how is it used to handle multiple asynchronous

operations simultaneously?

`Promise.all()` is a JavaScript method that takes an iterable (e.g., an array) of promises and returns a single promise. This new promise is fulfilled with an array of the resolved values from all the input promises, in the same order as the promises in the input iterable.

The key use case for `Promise.all()` is to handle multiple asynchronous operations simultaneously, waiting for all of them to complete before proceeding. If any of the promises in the iterable is rejected (encounters an error), the entire `Promise.all()` operation is rejected, and the first encountered rejection reason is used as the reason for the overall rejection.

Here's a basic example to illustrate how `Promise.all()` works:

```javascript
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve) =>
  setTimeout(() => resolve("First"), 1000)
);
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve) =>
  setTimeout(() => resolve("Second"), 2000)
);
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
  setTimeout(() => reject("Third Error"), 1500)
);

// Using Promise.all to handle multiple promises
Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then((values) => {
    console.log("All promises resolved:", values);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("One or more promises rejected:", error);
  });
```

In this example:

- `promise1`, `promise2`, and `promise3` are three asynchronous operations with different delays.
- `Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])` is used to wait for all promises to resolve or reject.
- If all promises resolve, the `.then` block is executed with an array of resolved values.
- If any promise rejects, the `.catch` block is executed with the reason of the first encountered rejection.

This ensures that all asynchronous operations are completed before moving on to the next steps in your program. It's particularly useful in scenarios where you have multiple independent asynchronous tasks that can be executed concurrently.
